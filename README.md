The Make Change Program takes in the total price of a customer's goods and the amount the customer tenders as input.  It then informs the cashier if enough money was tendered and if so, provides the change that is due.  The program specifically instructs the cashier which bills and pieces of change to give the customer.  It is designed to give the largest possible denominations of currency so as to give a customer a twenty dollar bill rather than four five dollar bills for example.
